##  What is a Network?

A **computer network** is a group of interconnected devices that communicate using specific protocols and transmission technologies. In cybersecurity, networks are both critical assets to protect and potential attack surfaces to exploit.

##  The OSI Model in Security Context

Understanding the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model is essential for identifying vulnerabilities and applying effective defenses at each layer:

| Layer | Name           | Security Focus                                   |
|-------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Physical        | Wiretapping, hardware keyloggers, signal jamming |
| 2     | Data Link       | MAC spoofing, ARP poisoning                      |
| 3     | Network         | IP spoofing, DDoS attacks, routing manipulation  |
| 4     | Transport       | Port scanning, TCP SYN floods                    |
| 5     | Session         | Session hijacking, replay attacks                |
| 6     | Presentation    | SSL stripping, data tampering                    |
| 7     | Application     | XSS, SQL injection, DNS attacks, API exploitation|

##  Core Network Security Concepts

- **Firewall:** Filters traffic based on rules (stateless/stateful)
- **IDS/IPS:** Detects and/or blocks malicious activity
- **VPNs:** Encrypt data over insecure networks
- **Network Segmentation:** Limits the scope of compromise
- **ACLs (Access Control Lists):** Define who can access what
- **Zero Trust Architecture:** Trust no one by default, verify everything
- **Authentication Protocols:** 802.1X, RADIUS, TACACS+ (did'nt get to that one yet...)

## Common Network Attacks

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** Intercept and manipulate communications
- **ARP Spoofing:** Redirect traffic by impersonating MAC addresses
- **DDoS Attacks:** Overwhelm a system with massive traffic
- **DNS Spoofing:** Redirect users to malicious websites
- **Packet Sniffing:** Intercept unencrypted data in transit
- **Session Hijacking:** Take control of active sessions
- **Port Scanning:** Identify open services and potential entry points

##  Essential Tools

| Tool        | Purpose                       |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| `nmap`      | Network scanning and mapping  |
| `wireshark` | Packet capture and analysis   |
| `netcat`    | Reading/writing data over TCP/UDP |
| `tcpdump`   | Command-line packet analysis  |
| `ettercap`  | MITM attacks and sniffing     |
| `arpspoof`  | ARP spoofing for MITM         |
| `aircrack-ng` | Wireless network exploitation |
| `traceroute`, `dig` | Network diagnostics     |

##  Defense Strategies

- **Encryption:** Secure communication using TLS, IPsec, etc.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** SIEM tools (e.g., Splunk, ELK) to detect anomalies
- **Patch Management:** Regularly update systems and devices
- **Access Control:** Principle of least privilege (PoLP)
- **User Awareness Training:** Prevent social engineering and phishing
- **Threat Hunting:** Proactive detection of anomalies and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

## âœ… Summary

Network security is an evolving discipline that combines **technical controls**, **policy enforcement**, and **constant vigilance**. From low-level hardware to high-level applications, each layer presents risks and opportunities for defense. Mastery of networking fundamentals is a core skill for any cybersecurity professional.
